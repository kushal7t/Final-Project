# Final Project
 COVID-19 and its effect on the stock market
Steps:
1) Set up a Git repository to allow you to collaborate on the Python solution
2) Read the daily confirmed cases and deaths into two dataframes can be found at this
github page:
a) confirmed_cases_url =
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse
_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed
_global.csv"
b) deaths_url =
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse
_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_glo
bal.csv"
3) Use pandas to create a dataframe that aggregates and sums both confirmed cases
and deaths on a global level
4) Research a stock for each below that reflects the following industries (it will be used
in the next step):
a) Overall American Market
b) Overall Canadian Market
c) Travel sector
d) The Real Estate sector
e) Precious metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum, etc)
5) Use AlphaVantage (the stock API used earlier in the course) to get the daily high and
low prices for your selected stocks
6) Append that info to the data frame created in step 3)
7) Create an approriate graph detailing your info - explain why you chose the graphs
you did, use matplotlib
Deliverables:
1) Git commit logs (20 Marks - you will want to do similar amounts of work, any showing
of a high skew of work towards one group member may result in an according
weighting of the overall mark!)
2) Python solution file(s) (60 Marks)
3) Generated visual output (20 Marks)
